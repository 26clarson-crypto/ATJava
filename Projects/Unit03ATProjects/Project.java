/* Use input validation to verify that the user entered the correct types of data
Your program should not crash if the wrong type of data is entered (for example, a text value is entered instead of an integer value).
Your program should print an error message and exit gracefully if the incorrect data was entered.
Your program should be able to parse the day of the week regardless of case or if the user uses the full spelling of the word (such as "Monday") or the abbreviated day ("mon").
Use an enumerated data type to represent the different types of customer (baby, child, adult, or senior)
Use an enumerated data type to represent the day of the week.
The output of your program should be neatly formatted with the columns and decimal places of the dollar values neatly aligned (see the sample program run at the end of this document). If the age of the passenger is not a valid integer, your program should print an error message and exit gracefully.
